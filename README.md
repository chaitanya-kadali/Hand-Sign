- Developed a real-time hand gesture recognition system using Media Pipe and RFC,achieving high accuracy through landmark-based feature extraction.
- Implemented a SIFT-based gesture recognition model with OpenCV,  enabling feature matching.
- Captures live hand images and translates recognized gestures into corresponding general language.
